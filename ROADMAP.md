# FlyTally Logbook Roadmap

**Status:** Active  
**Owner:** Filip Točík  
**Last updated:** 4 October 2026  
**Current production product version:** `2.7.0`  
**Next canonical unified release:** `3.4.0`

This is the canonical forward plan for `flytally-logbook`.

- `FEATURES.md` = what the product has / is intended to have.
- `ROADMAP.md` = order, dependencies, decisions and status.
- `CHANGELOG.md` = what actually changed.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` = current architecture and data-integrity invariants.
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` = implementation / verification workflow.
- `docs/product/VERSIONING.md` = numeric release/versioning rules.
- Detailed release contracts belong under `docs/product/`.
- Superseded / historical milestone detail belongs under `docs/history/`.

A release is not DONE until implementation, verification, required documentation and production closeout are complete.

## Versioning rule

From 4 October 2026 forward, active product planning uses numeric `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` release versions only.

- No new active E/F/B/SP/M-style milestone families.
- Use the target release number plus **Phase 1, Phase 2, ...**.
- Database schema version, certification payload version and backup-format version are independent technical counters.
- Historical letter-coded milestones are preserved in `docs/history/ROADMAP_PRE_NUMERIC_2026-10-04.md`.

## Status legend

- ✅ **DONE** — implemented, verified, merged and production-closed where applicable.
- 🚧 **ACTIVE** — current release.
- ➡️ **NEXT** — first release after ACTIVE.
- ⏳ **PLANNED** — accepted direction, not yet next.
- 🔬 **RESEARCH** — not implementation-ready.
- ⚠️ **BLOCKED / EXTERNAL** — depends on evidence or a decision outside the repo.

## Current production baseline

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| Core logbook / certified record integrity | ✅ Production |
| Aeroplane / Helicopter / Sailplane / Balloon / ULL / conservative Other | ✅ Production |
| Manual + GPS flight entry | ✅ Production baseline; simplification planned in 3.4.0 |
| GPS review / Day-Night / Night-time suggestions | ✅ Production; GPS remains advisory |
| Certification / correction revisions / audit history | ✅ Production |
| Recency / licences / evidence | ✅ Production |
| Sharing / Connections / instructor workflows | ✅ Production |
| Aircraft profiles / profile sharing / canonical validation | ✅ Production |
| Backup / restore / protected history | ✅ Production |
| Statistics / professional presentation | ✅ Production |
| Production DB schema | **v19** — independent from product version |
| Product release version | **2.7.0** |

## Canonical release sequence

| Order | Target | Workstream | Status | Dependency / reason |
| ---: | ---: | --- | :---: | --- |
| 1 | **3.4.0** | Flight Entry Simplification | 🚧 | Production use exposed excessive cognitive load in otherwise-correct Manual/GPS flow |
| 2 | **3.5.0** | Multi-aircraft remaining integrity audit | ➡️ | Resume historical/dynamic applicability audit after entry workflow stabilizes |
| 3 | **3.6.0** | Saved-date / timezone semantics · #144 | ⏳ | Persisted default date can be wrong around timezone boundaries |
| 4 | **3.7.0** | Currency / monetary semantics · #136 | ⏳ | Account currency vs stored monetary denomination needs one contract |
| 5 | **3.8.0** | Multi-aircraft heterogeneous onboarding proof | ⏳ | Prove no-code onboarding across supported categories |
| 6 | **3.9.0** | Multi-aircraft sharing / recovery / scale closeout | ⏳ | Close cross-workflow and scale evidence |
| — | — | Professional Logbook Platform | 🔬 | No release number until scope is frozen |

**Pre-emption rule:** confirmed production, security or data-integrity defects may interrupt this order. Convenience/visual polish may not weaken evidence, validation, certification or historical integrity.

# 3.4.0 — Flight Entry Simplification — ACTIVE

Detailed contract: `docs/product/3_4_0_FLIGHT_ENTRY_SIMPLIFICATION.md`  
Independent review reconciliation: `docs/product/3_4_0_REVIEW_RECONCILIATION.md`  
UI matrix: `docs/product/3_4_0_FLIGHT_ENTRY_UI_MATRIX.md`

## Product goal

Make routine Manual/GPS entry materially simpler and more cockpit/iPad-friendly without weakening source provenance, validation, certification integrity, recency, sharing or historical record protection.

Target common single-flight flow:

**Source → Flight details → Save & certify**

with secondary/contextual information progressively disclosed.

## Frozen decisions

- GPS values remain advisory/editable; missing or ambiguous evidence fails closed.
- IFR remains pilot-entered.
- Existing SERA Day/Night/Night-time suggestion semantics remain unchanged.
- Certification remains an explicit pilot action.
- **Save & certify** is single-flight only in 3.4.0.
- **Save draft** remains available and is the implicit/default submit behavior.
- Pressing Enter must never certify.
- Certification hash/compliance/revision logic is reused from the current persisted-row authority path.
- If draft save succeeds but certification fails, the flight remains a draft with an explicit blocker message.
- Current generic GPS “I reviewed this flight” gate is removed only together with its server requirement.
- Only a non-blocking GPS-quality warning may require targeted acknowledgement; T&G detection, near-boundary SERA manual fallback and invalid profile state do not get extra acknowledgement checkboxes.
- Multi-flight GPS remains all-or-none **draft save only** in 3.4.0; no batch certification.
- Save & certify never sends PIC/crew/instructor invitations automatically.
- Regulatory category / evidence basis is part of the compact context and pre-certification summary.
- Collapsed sections must summarize their actual state; hidden must never mean invented zero/default.
- ULL category filtering remains correct; non-applicable Part-FCL/SFCL/BFCL purposes stay hidden.
- No new generic structured Training / practice purpose.
- Existing purpose codes/history remain backward-compatible.
- No DB migration is assumed.

## Phase 1 — Discovery / contract freeze — DONE

Repository reconciliation is substantially complete.

Confirmed current-state facts:
- current certification reads the persisted owned row, runs compliance, hashes certification v8 from that row and conditionally certifies only an uncertified record;
- current post-save page is a genuine second full Logbook-data review surface, not just a confirmation dialog;
- GPS `part_<n>_reviewed` is server-required but not persisted/certification-protected;
- Manual/GPS creation already uses flight fingerprint + PostgreSQL advisory locks + duplicate checks;
- GPS multi-flight draft creation is already transactional for parent/track/required connected-crew rows;
- recency and public-share authority require certified flights;
- `purpose_code` is certification-protected from certification payload v3 onward;
- Training-purpose UI is category-aware but server normalization also applies role/evidence gating, so one shared applicability contract is required.

Phase 1 closeout:
- KEEP / COLLAPSE / CONDITIONAL / REMOVE-DUPLICATE matrix frozen;
- pre-certification summary fields and blocker-to-disclosure mapping frozen;
- Enter/default-submit rule frozen: implicit submit = draft only;
- shared Training-purpose applicability predicate implemented and source-covered;
- independent review reconciled against actual repository behavior.

## Phase 2 — Information hierarchy — DONE

### GPS source
Default visible:
- source/file name;
- point count / detected-flight count;
- one concise source state;
- real GPS-quality warning when present.

Conditional:
- split controls hidden for one clean flight;
- split editor appears only for multi-flight/manual split/ambiguity;
- map + altitude/speed profile under **Review GPS track**;
- warning may auto-open visual review;
- raw diagnostics remain secondary.

### Flight context
Replace the large Common details area with one compact editable summary showing:
- aircraft registration/type;
- regulatory category / evidence basis;
- role;
- operation / engine where applicable;
- per-flight Role/Crew divergence when present.

Billing remains a secondary cost context, not a substitute for regulatory evidence.

### Flight details
Default visible:
- date;
- departure / arrival;
- landings total + Day/Night where applicable;
- Off-block / Takeoff / Landing / On-block;
- Night / IFR where applicable;
- concise Notes affordance;
- any blocking evidence problem.

Duplicate helper/provenance/status copy should be removed when one compact source/status cue is sufficient.

Phase 2 closeout:
- clean single-flight GPS track review is collapsed by default;
- multi-flight / ambiguous / warned GPS review remains surfaced;
- the old wizard-step chrome is removed;
- compact Flight context exposes aircraft + regulatory evidence basis + role + applicable operation/engine;
- Billing is no longer part of the primary context summary;
- clean GPS quality no longer emits a redundant standalone status line;
- incomplete imports jump to the first flight section that still needs evidence.

## Phase 3 — Progressive optional/contextual detail — ACTIVE

Collapsed by default:
- additional crew;
- detailed aircraft provenance;
- Training purpose;
- Task / exercise;
- Costs / additional expenses;
- professional context;
- extended movement evidence when not required;
- source diagnostics.

Auto-open only when required, populated, invalid or explicitly opened.

Collapsed summaries must truthfully represent state and distinguish unset/unavailable/not tracked from explicit zero where the existing domain distinguishes them.

### Training-purpose reconciliation
- preserve the existing seven structured purpose codes;
- preserve category-aware regulatory filtering;
- keep ULL non-applicable Part-FCL/SFCL/BFCL purposes hidden;
- do not add a generic structured Training / practice marker;
- keep Task / exercise for ordinary descriptive detail;
- make one shared applicability predicate authoritative for both picker visibility and server persistence;
- preserve historical stored/certified purpose values even if current applicability differs.

## Phase 4 — Single-flight Save & certify

Primary explicit action:
**Save & certify flight**

Secondary:
**Save draft**

Rules:
- missing/default intent = Save draft;
- Enter/default submit cannot certify;
- save uses the existing canonical create path;
- certification re-reads the persisted row and uses one shared certification helper derived from current `certifyFlight`;
- hash is never calculated directly from raw form payload;
- certification failure after successful save leaves an owned draft and surfaces the blocker;
- successful certification requires no second certification click;
- existing correction-revision workflow remains authoritative for certified-flight edits;
- no sharing/invitation/verification side effect is triggered automatically.

### Pre-certification summary
Show next to the action:
- date;
- route;
- aircraft registration/type;
- regulatory category / evidence basis;
- role / required crew evidence;
- operation / engine where applicable;
- four movement times;
- landings Day/Night;
- Night / IFR;
- certification blockers.

Consequence copy:
**Certified flights are locked; later changes are recorded as corrections.**

## Phase 5 — GPS review-gate simplification / multi-flight safety

- remove the generic `I reviewed this flight` checkbox and server requirement;
- require targeted acknowledgement only for a non-blocking GPS-quality warning that the pilot is permitted to accept;
- T&G count remains visible/editable but gets no extra checkbox;
- near-boundary SERA remains manual/unavailable as today;
- invalid profile/evidence remains blocking;
- multi-flight import continues to save all parts atomically as drafts only;
- no 3.4.0 batch certification.

## Phase 6 — Responsive / interaction polish

Required:
- desktop;
- iPad landscape;
- iPad portrait;
- mobile 390;
- compact mobile/reflow;
- light + dark.

Acceptance:
- materially fewer default-visible sections than production 2.7.0;
- one obvious primary action for the current context;
- no horizontal overflow;
- blocker identifies which disclosure needs attention;
- async actions have pending/disabled duplicate-submit protection;
- keyboard/focus order remains usable;
- save/certification result is announced accessibly;
- no raw errors.

## Phase 7 — Release closeout

Required evidence:
- targeted tests during implementation;
- TypeScript;
- full unit/regression candidate gate;
- PostgreSQL acceptance for save/certification, duplicate/concurrency and multi-flight atomicity;
- certification parity test between old explicit certification and new Save & certify on equivalent persisted rows;
- authenticated browser coverage for Manual + GPS, Save draft + Save & certify, blockers, GPS warning acknowledgement, Enter-key behavior and responsive states;
- production build;
- PR CI;
- production deployment + smoke + runtime-error check;
- ROADMAP / FEATURES / CHANGELOG reconciliation;
- one-time product-version reconciliation to **3.4.0** only at ship time.

### 3.4.0 Definition of Done

- simplified hierarchy production deployed;
- single-flight same-page Save & certify verified;
- default/Enter submit cannot certify;
- Save draft remains valid;
- multi-flight import remains atomic draft-only;
- generic reviewed checkbox removed without losing required GPS-warning evidence;
- Training-purpose UI/server applicability unified;
- certification/audit/correction/share/recency authority unchanged;
- responsive light/dark acceptance passes;
- `package.json`, visible app version, CHANGELOG release heading and Git tag agree on `3.4.0`.

# 3.5.0 — Multi-aircraft remaining integrity audit — NEXT

Goal: finish the remaining historical/dynamic applicability integrity work without reintroducing mutable-current-profile dependence into historical evidence.

Scope:
- audit remaining recency consumers for current-profile dependencies;
- preserve established ordinary ULL → SEP behavior;
- preserve explicit effective-dated `part_fcl_credit_*` provenance;
- verify Manual/GPS snapshot equivalence where applicable;
- preserve certification/revision compatibility.

No migration is assumed until evidence proves one necessary.

# 3.6.0 — Saved-date / timezone semantics — PLANNED

Issue: #144

Before code:
- define which defaults use configured user calendar timezone;
- identify evidence that must remain UTC;
- define midnight/day-boundary tests;
- decide whether any existing persisted data requires treatment.

GPS/FCL.050 UTC evidence must not be converted into local-time evidence by convenience.

# 3.7.0 — Currency / monetary semantics — PLANNED

Issue: #136

Before code:
- define whether account currency is display/default denomination or record authority;
- classify records that already persist currency;
- classify legacy values with/without explicit denomination;
- define export/backup consequences;
- no automatic FX conversion without an explicit future rule.

# 3.8.0 — Multi-aircraft heterogeneous onboarding proof — PLANNED

Representative Aeroplane, Helicopter, Sailplane/TMG, Balloon, ULL and Other profiles must pass the same canonical workflow without make/model-specific runtime branches.

Proof includes:
- catalogue/manual identity;
- Add/Edit;
- Quick Add;
- deactivate/reactivate;
- flight selection;
- applicability guidance;
- desktop/iPad/mobile light/dark acceptance.

# 3.9.0 — Multi-aircraft sharing / recovery / scale closeout — PLANNED

Scope:
- aircraft sharing preserves recipient ownership + canonical validation;
- exact backup/restore preserves profile + protected-flight evidence;
- multi-profile picker/library behavior measured before optimization;
- deletion/deactivation remains safe when historical flights reference registration;
- complete regression / PostgreSQL / browser / build closeout.

# Research — Professional Logbook Platform

No product version is assigned yet.

Possible future scope:
- organization/operator accounts;
- fleet workflows;
- instructor/student organizational evidence;
- controlled reports;
- team permissions.

Promotion requires a dedicated research/design decision first.

## Permanent engineering constraints

- One canonical flight/data model.
- Manual/GPS/Create/Edit business rules converge rather than fork.
- Invalid combinations fail closed; no silent repair.
- Certified/finalized history is revisioned/audited, never destructively overwritten.
- Recency/currency/compliance claims are evidence-first.
- Auth/ownership is server-enforced.
- Schema changes are explicit deployment prerequisites.
- Production deployment is not inferred from build/merge success.
- Testing evidence is reported exactly as run.
- ROADMAP / FEATURES / CHANGELOG close in the same work cycle.

## Historical record

Pre-standardization milestone history, including the prior E/F/B/SP/M labels and detailed closeout evidence, is preserved at:

`docs/history/ROADMAP_PRE_NUMERIC_2026-10-04.md`

Historical docs remain evidence/context only. If they conflict with this ROADMAP on current priority, this ROADMAP controls.
